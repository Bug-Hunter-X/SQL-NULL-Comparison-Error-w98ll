In SQL, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with `NULL` values and comparisons.  Consider this scenario:  `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE manager_id = NULL;`  This query will *not* return employees with `NULL` manager_id.  To correctly find employees with `NULL` manager_ids, you must use the `IS NULL` operator: `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL;`  Similarly, `manager_id != NULL` is incorrect; use `manager_id IS NOT NULL`.  This stems from the three-valued logic of SQL where `NULL` doesn't equate to any value, including itself.
