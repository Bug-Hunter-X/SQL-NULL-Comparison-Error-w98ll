This repository demonstrates a common error in SQL queries involving NULL values.  The `bug.sql` file contains a query that incorrectly attempts to compare a column to NULL using the equals operator.  The correct solution, using the `IS NULL` operator, is provided in `bugSolution.sql`.  Understanding the three-valued logic of SQL and the proper use of IS NULL is crucial for writing accurate and reliable SQL queries.
